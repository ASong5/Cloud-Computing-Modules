# A1

Shell program that establishes a connection with AWS S3 via Boto3 SDK to perform CRUD tasks and other generic shell operations; e.g., creating/deleting buckets, transferring/copying objects between buckets or sub-directories, changing current working directories, listing objects, etc.

The shell emulates the nuances and functionality of a regular Linux shell. So despite the flat structure of the S3 file system, the shell facilitates and performs operations in a manner that is conducive to modern hierarchical file systems.

# A2

Library of modules to work with AWS DynamoDB. The suite of functions found in this assignment allows the user to perform CRUD operations on their DynamoDB tables with country-related and GDP-related data (provided by prof). Additionally, it also has functions for querying and listing objects. It also includes a console application that facilitates and streamlines these operations for the user. In addition, the application can generate two types of reports from data in the tables: 
- Report A: data for a specific country
- Report B: data for all countries on a specific date

# A3

Automation script for the dynamic generation of GCP and Azure VMs. Given a file with various input parameters, the script can connect to GCP and Azure and fire up VMs seamlessly and without any work by the user. Once the script terminates, a report log is generated with any necessary information about the VM creation.

# A4

Docker container running on AWS lambda to allow for subscribed users of an S3 bucket to automatically receive their own copy of objects that are transferred into the bucket.
