Notes and Limitations
- keys in .conf file must be the same as the one required to execute the command
- Project is not required in the documentation for azure VM, even though it is in the specs (assuming it was a typo)
- ports are opened for both tcp and udp in GCP
- .conf files must be "Azure.conf" and "GCP.conf" exactly and must be in the same directory as automate.py
- Assuming proper credentials and cloud platform setup properly by grader
- If no vm was created (e.g., all of them exist already), no documentation file is created
- both Azure.conf and GCP.conf are required for the program to work

Usage: 
- Run the command: ./automate.py
